# Colour Punch - MS2 Re-write.
## Overview:

### "Colour Punch" is a take on the classic game called 'Simon', where players try to memorise the colour combination generated by the game. The more colours you memorise or "punch" correctly, the more your score increases.

## Instructions:

### Simply match the sequence displayed, if you follow correctly then you score a point. If you get it wrong you lose. The player can activate the strict button which will reset the game if the player loses the game, if the strict button is switched off then the player simply starts where they left off.
